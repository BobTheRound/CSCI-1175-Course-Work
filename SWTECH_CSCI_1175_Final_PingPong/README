Greetings and salutations!
This project, which I have dubbed "Athleticly Disinclined Ping Pong", was, as soon as I discovered how sockets and I/O streams worked, conjured up!
For now the project is simply hitting a ball at the wall (Server in this case) and the server hitting the ball back.
the server will send you a ball coordinate, the client (user side) will then place an invisible button on the grid of buttons.
the client will give you two buttons as "Hint!"s that are touching the ball but not on the ball.
Using deductive reasoning you must hit the ball back to the wall! Future iterations will include multiplayer functionality as well as UI beautification!
